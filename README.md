The analysis indicates a relationship between the per student budget and academic performance. Schools with a lower per student budget (<$585) tend to have higher passing rates in both math and reading, as well as a higher overall passing rate. On the other hand, schools with a higher per student budget (>$630) show lower passing rates.

The size of the school appears to influence academic outcomes. This suggests that smaller student populations may contribute to a more favorable learning environment.

Schools within the same spending range often exhibit similar academic performance. For instance, schools in the $585-630 spending range consistently show high passing rates, while those in the $630-645 range consistently show lower passing rates. This suggests that budget allocation plays a crucial role in determining academic success.
